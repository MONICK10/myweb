    <h1>Understanding Blockchain Technology</h1> 

    <div class="section-box">
        <h2>What is Blockchain?</h2>
        <p>Blockchain is a decentralized and distributed ledger technology that records transactions across many computers, {Link: according to AlmaBetter https://www.almabetter.com/bytes/tutorials/html/hyperlinks-and-anchor-tag-in-html}}. Each block in the chain contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block, a timestamp, and transaction data, {Link: according to AlmaBetter https://www.almabetter.com/bytes/tutorials/html/hyperlinks-and-anchor-tag-in-html}}. This structure makes the blockchain resistant to modification of the data. Once recorded, the data in any given block cannot be altered retroactively without altering all subsequent blocks, which would require the collusion of the network majority, {Link: according to AlmaBetter https://www.almabetter.com/bytes/tutorials/html/hyperlinks-and-anchor-tag-in-html}}. This inherent security is one of its most attractive features, ensuring data integrity and trust without the need for a central authority.</p>
        <p>The concept of blockchain was first introduced by a person or group using the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto in 2008 to create Bitcoin, a cryptocurrency. However, the technology's applications extend far beyond cryptocurrencies, impacting various industries from finance and supply chain to healthcare and voting systems.</p>

        <h2>Key Components of Blockchain</h2>
        <p>Understanding blockchain technology requires familiarity with its fundamental building blocks:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Distributed Ledger:</b> A shared, immutable record of transactions.</li>
            <li><b>Cryptography:</b> Secures transactions and links blocks.</li>
            <li><b>Consensus Mechanisms:</b> Rules that determine how transactions are validated.</li>
            <li><b>Smart Contracts:</b> Self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement directly written into code.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Types of Blockchain Networks</h3>
        <p>Blockchains can be categorized into different types based on their accessibility and governance:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Public Blockchains:
                <ul>
                    <li>Open to anyone for participation.</li>
                    <li>Examples: Bitcoin, Ethereum.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Private Blockchains:
                <ul>
                    <li>Controlled by a single organization.</li>
                    <li>Membership is restricted.</li>
                    <li>Examples: Hyperledger Fabric.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Consortium Blockchains:
                <ul>
                    <li>Governed by a group of organizations.</li>
                    <li>Offers a balance between centralization and decentralization.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
